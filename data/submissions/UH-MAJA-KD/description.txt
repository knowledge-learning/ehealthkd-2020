method_name: BiLSTMCRF-Dependency
method_description: Both tasks were solved separately. Task A, using a BiLSTM-CRF architecture with BERT-based contextual embeddings as input features, as well as other syntactic ones. Task B, using a RNN-based architecture lying on dependency tree structures, with a variety of input features, including BERT-based embeddings. Tags: SDEN
