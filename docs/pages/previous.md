# Previous edition of the task

The eHealth-KD 2020 challenge is an enhanced version of the [eHealth-KD 2019](https://knowledge-learning.github.io/ehealthkd-2019) and [TASS 2018 Task 3](http://www.sepln.org/workshops/tass/2018/task-3/). In this new version the same annotation and data from the 2019 edition will be used. A brand new test will be annotated, and the previous test set will be released as part of the new training set.

Inspired by the successful participation of 6 teams in the previous version, and the insightful recommendations that many of the participants provided, we have redesigned this yearâ€™s task to be both more challenging and more objectively evaluated. Hence, we divided the evaluation scenarios so that each specific Subtask is evaluated independently, and also provide a scenario for evaluating the complete pipeline.
Additionally, [a new scenario](evaluation#optional-alternative-domain-evaluation-scenario-4) has been added which will challenge participants to develop systems that can generalize to a new, unknown domain with very little training data and a short time for response. We expect to encourage participants to design system from the ground up that can generalize well and rely less on domain-specific heuristics. Furthermore, we expect to encourage research and development of novel transfer learning techniques, specially techniques in the Spanish language and for complex knowledge domains.
