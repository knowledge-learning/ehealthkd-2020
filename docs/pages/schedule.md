# Schedule

* 📢 Testing files [are ready](https://knowledge-learning.github.io/ehealthkd-2020/resources#testing-input-files). The [testing phase in Codalab](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/23454#participate) is officially open !!
* 👉 Due to the potential difficulties caused by COVID-19 to participants,
  we are **delaying all dates** starting with the test set release **2 weeks** into the future.
* 👉 COVID19 related documents, i.e. news and documentation, will be played.
* 👉 An additional 100 sentences extracted from the Spanish version of Wikinews are available for cross-validation purposes, to evaluate transfer learning approaches (folder `data/development/transfer`) [(read more)](resources#transfer-learning-corpora).
* 👉 An additional 3000 automatically annotated sentences from Medline are available for further training. Note that these sentences have been manually revised and hence are not considered gold standard [(read more)](resources#automatic-corpora).
